<ul>
	This has been tested on Linux host machine, for Windows consult VirtualBox user manual. Link is posted on my lab schedule under resources.
		<ol>
			<li>Create a folder on your host machine.</li>
			<li>Before the machine is running, access its settings and navigate towards "Shared Folders".</li>
			<li>Click the icon to create a new shared folder, locate the path to folder you just created in step 1. Name the folder as you want it to show up on guest system. Make sure <b>"auto-mount"</b> and <b>"Make Permanent"</b> options are activated. <br>

			<li>You should be all set. Your shared folder should be created under <b>/media/sf_[YOUR_FOLDER_NAME]</b>. Try creating some files both on host and guest to make sure it's working.</li>
